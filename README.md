<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>Printf is a C programming library function "int printf(const char *format, ...)" that sends formatted output to stdout (standard output library) to call it into the C program, and using it for simple strings or formatted specifiers that allow us to print different types of data. Here we will be collaborating to creating a printf project that diversify on the its features in order to know what a powerful tool it is.</p>

<h2>Compilation</h2>

The directory contents should be compiled with the following command:

```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c
```

* `_printf()` function may be used, in any C language program.  This is the
prototype:

```
_printf(const char *[FORMAT], ...)
```
* `./man_printf`: manual file including the manual for how our custom printf
functions.
