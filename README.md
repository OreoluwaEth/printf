Group Project on creating Printf function
Collaborators 
Prince Iroatu and Oreoluwa Adepegba

Project Description 
Printf is a C programming library function "int printf(const char *format, ...)" that sends formatted output to stdout (standard output library) to call it into the C program, and using it for simple strings or formatted specifiers that allow us to print different types of data. Here we will be collaborating to creating a printf project that diversify on the its features in order to know what a powerful tool it is.

Compilation
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c
